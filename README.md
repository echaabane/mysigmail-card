## Motivation

In the world of development there are more and more dependencies and vendor-locked. There are situations where entire nations are "cancelled" for political reasons. Ordinary people suffer. It shouldn't be. 

I love open source, and I contribute to it. Right now I want to give back to the community my commercial project [MySigMail Card](https://card.mysigmail.com). 

## Roadmap

The project was written almost 3 years ago and so its code base is outdated. So before I give it to the community I will rewrite it from scratch using modern solutions. 

## Support

MySigMail Card is open source project and completely free to use.

However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support MySigMail Card development via the following methods:

## Development

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## How can I help?

In the process of writing from scratch I think there will be a lot of rethinking, so no help is needed until I get a stable release. But I don't mind if someone else wants to. 

Now a good help would be your recognition and star for the project to gain visibility on GitHub.
